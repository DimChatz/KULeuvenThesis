# Versioning
### V-0.0.1 (27/2 - 1/3)
Tried to make foundation work -> failed, some functions missing
Created berts dataset preprocessing + simple model -> failed, wrong data former for torch

### V-0.1.1 (2/3 - 4/3)
Debugging -> made simple model work -> overfitting af
added weigths -> still overfitting af

### V-0.1.2 5/3
Added callbacks for early stopping and reducing LR
Added training visualizer for loss and accuracy
Added F1 score
Fixed Model training and preprocessing
create more complex model -> is shit af

## To do
- Add visualization of preproc
- Add visualization of training
- ○ Create more complex model
- Add more metrics
- Added LR reduction and early stoppying callbacks
- ○ add ptbxl data
